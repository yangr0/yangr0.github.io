                &quot;I had the privilege of working with Raymond as an intern for our Engineering department from September 2020 to November 2021. Raymondâ€™s work as a Software Engineering Intern was outstanding. Particularly with his contributions to the Atomic Red Team project, product development, C2 payload creation, and successful integration of MythicC2 into our adversary emulation solution.

His adaptability and quick learning in our fast-paced startup environment were impressive, marking him as both a proactive team player and a quick learner.

                Raymond&apos;s combination of technical skills, logical reasoning, and soft skills truly set him apart. He is not just a learner but a leader, whose contributions left a lasting impact. Raymond is undoubtedly poised for continued growth and success in any academic or professional setting. I&apos;m 100% confident in his ability to contribute significantly to any organization he joins.&quot;
