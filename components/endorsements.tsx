                &quot;I had the privilege of working with Raymond as an intern for our Engineering department from September 2020 to November 2021. Raymondâ€™s work as a Software Engineering Intern was outstanding. Particularly with his contributions to the Atomic Red Team project, product development, C2 payload creation, and successful integration of MythicC2 into our adversary emulation solution.

              <br />

                Raymond displayed exceptional leadership by effectively mentoring other interns and showcasing a remarkable ability to translate complex design principles into practical learning experiences. His adaptability and quick learning in our fast-paced startup environment were impressive, marking him as both a proactive team player and a quick learner.

                Raymond&apos;s combination of technical skills, logical reasoning, and soft skills truly set him apart. He is not just a learner but a leader, whose contributions left a lasting impact. Raymond is undoubtedly poised for continued growth and success in any academic or professional setting. I&apos;m 100% confident in his ability to contribute significantly to any organization he joins.&quot;
